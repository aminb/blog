    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p id="about">
      I believe we humans deserve better than spending time fighting with crappy software.
      I'm striving to improve that and make software more reliable through use of formal methods
      like theorem proving and type systems. While I love high-level functional programming,
      I also enjoy dabbling into low-evel stuff once in a while.
      I am a firm believer in software freedom, and a volunteer webmaster for the GNU project.
