      <p>
        My academic <abbr>cv</abbr> is available as <a href="/cv.pdf">cv.pdf</a>,
        and my professional resume is available as <a href="/resume.pdf">resume.pdf</a>.

        I'm interested in functional programming and functional languages, type systems, and formal methods.
        I love writing Haskell and I'm looking into Rust as well.
        Feel free to drop me a line if you like to geek out about any of the above.
